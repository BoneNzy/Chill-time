# Chill-time

This is a webpage with one wallpaper(currently only one will be updating it) and few music tracks but will be uploading more of it later on.
That upper statement implies to me only.

What you can do with it?  
You can add your own songs to the `music directory` and don't forget to add it to the javascript file and the name of the song must be similar to the name you added to the directory.

How to add to your local device?  
SSh  
<git clone git@github.com:BoneNzy/Chill-time.git>  
HTML  
`git clone https://github.com/BoneNzy/Chill-time.git`  

And you are good to go, enjoy your own time with it, and please raise an issue if you find a bug or you want to add something.
